      hacking
    </a>
        <br />
        <br /> It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a
        spirit of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value".

        Meaning of hwpplayers
    </h1>
    <p>
        hwpplayers community is founded in the date November 19, 2015 or earlier.I was reading philosophy books and realized that philosophy discipline is another approach that anaylze science theory and concepts. That is why hwp is "hard working philosophers".Player
        word is coming from a FPS game named Quake.When you start the game and look for your profile you'll see a player name "player1". For a community name it is players as plural. Thus it became hard working philosophers players which represents "playful
        cleverness" and "hack value".<br />Happy hacking !

        Meaning of our logo
    </h1>
    <p>
        hwpplayers community has a “level system” like in games. We use that system for learning. We start from the basic ideas and try to learn everything about the idea.That's why we use rainbow logo. It has the colors which contains all the reflections of
        white color.Thus we can see "levels" of white color.
